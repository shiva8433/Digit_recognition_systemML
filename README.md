# Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow 

   This project is a handwritten digit recognition system that uses TensorFlow, an open-source Python library developed by 
   the Google Brain labs for deep learning research.

# Project Description

  The project uses the popular MNIST dataset for training and testing purposes. The neural network is built and trained to 
  recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.

# Requirements
 Python 3.x
 TensorFlow
 OpenCV

# Installation
  Clone the repository.
  Install the required libraries using pip.
  Run the code.
# Usage
  Run the code.
  Draw a digit on the given space.
  Click on the Recognize button to recognize the digit that is written on the given space.
  Click on the Clear button to clear the writings on it.
# Credits
   This project was inspired by MACHINE LEARNING COURSE by YBI FOUNDATION
